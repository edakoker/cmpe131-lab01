Using branches in Git is powerful because it lets team members work in parallel without breaking the main code. In this lab, I saw how I could make changes on a separate branch and later merge them into main safely.

Branches help prevent problems such as overwriting teammatesâ€™ work or mixing unfinished features into the main project. This makes collaboration safer and keeps the project history clear and organized.
